<br>
  <br>  I'm a huge fan of books and I absolutely adore them.  You'll probably find <br>
  <br>  me reading one during lunch time or on the bus.  But what I love nearly as much <br>
  <br>  as reading them is buying them.  The biggest reason why I'm constantly running <br>
  <br>   out of shelf space.  There's just something so satisfying to me about <br>
  <br>  purchasing a portable, brand new world wrapped up in a beautiful cover.  My <br>
  <br>  favorite genres are horror, action/ adventure, fantasy, and mystery.  Every <br>
  <br>  summer I go on a mystery/ psychological thriller marathon except this year, <br>
   <br> the marathon has <i>run</i> into the year with me.  I also like making puns. :) <br>

    (This is a watercolor collage I did for my room this summer.)
    <br>
   <br> Painting is a way for me to relax while expressing myself in different ways.  It <br>
   <br> also allows me to create pieces that I can share with those I care about.  I really <br>
    <br> only paint with acrylic and watercolor but am always open to try different medias. <br>

    <br> Lately, I've been interested in cooking, baking, and experimenting with different <br>
    <br> food combinations.  The science and chemistry behind them is pretty cool and so <br>
    <br> is the way different flavors can compliment each other or totally ruin both of <br>
    <br> their flavors.  I'm still new to the whole thing though so I don't feel too <br>
    <br>confident in my abilities but I hope to improve with more practice.  Cooking <br>
    <br> is also a way to connect with others so that makes it enjoyable as well.  I've<br>
    <br> also been interested in different countries and was curious to see how similar <br>
    <br> or different their culture and food is to mine.  One such country is Japan. I use <br>
    <br> this <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/">cooking blog</a> when I want to make a Japanese dish or just <br>
    <br>  learn about the culture. <br>
