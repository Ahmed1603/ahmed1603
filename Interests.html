    <br> There are a whole bunch of things that I'm currently into or <br>
    <br> just generally like.  One of these things is cats!!  Cats are <br>
    <br>  awesome balls of floof that have some serious attitude problems <br>
    <br> but are still great companions nonetheless which is why my family and I took <br>
    <br> in two stray kittens.  Unfortunately, one ran away (The male kitten. It's <br>
    <br>  usually the male.) on a secret mission and we still haven't heard back <br>
    <br> from him yet.  Here are a bunch more things that I'm into. <br>

<br>
    <br> Voltron!!  I don't usually get drawn into or hooked on shows too <br>
    <br>  easily but this show has totally been out of this world. (Literally.)  The <br>
    <br> characters are amusing and touching and the plot is great so I highly <br>
    <br> recommend it.  I don't know how else to describe it besides saying <br>
    <br>  that it's about a group of seven beings (five humans and two Alteans) <br>
    <br> who protect the universe from evil beings.  That's obviously the watered <br>
    <br> down version because it's so much better and interesting than that.  Check out <br>
    <br> <a href="http://www.voltron.com/">this website</a> to learn more about Voltron. <br>

    <br> My plants are like my family.  They provide my house with beauty, <br>
    <br> clean air, and are cool companions.  My favorite ones are succulents, <br>
    <br> rubber plants, snake plants, and peperomia.  They're quite easy to care <br>
    <br>  for because they aren't such high maintenance types like some other plants. <br>
    <br> This is good because I'm fairly inexperienced when it comes to plants. <br>

    <br> Doodling is something I end up doing with or without thinking.  This happens <br>
    <br>so frequently, doodles end up across most if not all of my papers at some <br>
    <br> point or other.  They range from cute animals or geometric shapes to random <br>
    <br> designs formed from multiple intersecting lines and shading with a few smaller <br>
    <br> shapes tossed in.
