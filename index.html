<!--intro paragraph-->

<p class="w3-myfont" align="center">


    <br>   There are a few reasons why this ol' webpage was brought into existence.  <br>
    <br> The first and foremost reason is so that I don't flunk this project.  The second <br>
   <br> reason is to help you get to know me better. For starters, my name is Fatemah Ahmed. <br>
<br> I am in tenth grade, I'll be 16 in October, and am a Fall baby that likes spring better. <br>
   <br>  My nationality is Indian but I was born in Illinois.  Fun fact, even though I'm Indian, my <br>
   <br> tongue can't tolerate very spicy foods. :/ My favorite colors are grey (because cat hair <br>
    <br> isn't really visible on it) and royal blue 'cuz why not. I prefer sunrises to sunsets and <br>
    <br> savory foods to sweet foods. My family isn't too big or too small and consists of my mom, <br>
   <br> dad, older brother, younger sister, younger brother, our cat, and me. A few hobbies of mine <br>
    <br> are reading, painting, and cooking.  Now that introductions are out of the way, check out <br>
    <br> the rest of my super cool website. :)
