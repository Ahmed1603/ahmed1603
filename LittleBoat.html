<h1 align ="center"> Here's a brief summary of the history of boatkind</h1>

<p align ="center"> 
    <br> Boats used to be pretty small and cute back in the old days.  But then <br>
    <br> the human population started to grow and with it, the need for transportation <br> 
    <br> due to trade and travel. So the brilliant idea to create bigger boats came <br>
    <br> about.  That's how many of the most famous boats were invented, such as the <br>
    <br> Titanic.  From there, boats just kept getting bigger and longer.  Sure small boats <br>
    <br> are still around but they're mostly used for private trips or fishing as a hobby. <br>
    <br> The larger ones are used for businesses such as the fish market or cruises.  <br>
