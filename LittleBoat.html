<h1 align ="center"> Here's a brief summary of the history of boatkind</h1>

<p align ="center"> Boats used to be pretty small and cute back in the old days.  But then
the human population started to grow and with it, the need for transportation due to trade and travel.
So the brilliant idea to create bigger boats came about.  That's how many of the most famous boats were
invented, such as the Titanic.  From there, boats just kept getting bigger and longer.  Sure small boats
are still around but they're mostly used for private trips or fishing as a hobby.  The larger ones are used
for businesses such as the fish market or cruises.  Click on the button below to watch the evolution of boatkind.</p>
