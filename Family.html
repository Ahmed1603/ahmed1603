    Like I mentioned earlier, my family isn't too big or too small.  <br>
    We're a pretty cool family, though.  Here's a chart to get to
    know them a little better.<br> </p>

    <br>These are my parents on a cruise.<br>
    <br>This next one is of my older brother and his catch on a fishing trip.<br>
    <br>The one after that is a picture of my younger sister and I at the beach.  The kid on the<br>
    <br>right is my younger brother.  The last one is a group shot. This was an awesome<br>
    <br>trip because it was completely spontaneous and on a Sunday. </p>

    This one is from Aysha's 12th birthday.  (Yes, those are Pusheen cake pops.)<br>
    <br>The one after that is her posing with flowers.</p>

    <br>The first one is of Yusuf after Eid prayer a couple summers ago.  The<br>
    <br> second one is from that same summer.  We're petting my uncle's cats.<br>
    <br>The last one is Aysha and I posing with a pretty bush in front of the same uncle's<br>
    <br> house from this summer. </p>

    <br>Here are a bunch of pictures of our cats, Twix and Biscuit.<br>
<br>In the first one, Twix is hanging his head over the side of my bunkbed.  The<br>
    <br>  second one is him sleeping on the sofa.  The third one is him putting<br>
    <br>a not so subtle pause on my studying.  The fourth one is of biscuit<br>
    <br> having a jolly good time in the laundry basket.  In the fifth one, we had<br>
    <br> wrapped Biscuit up in a swaddle.  The sixth picture is of Biscuit demanding<br>
    <br> that I pay attention to her and not my book.  The last one is of them chilling<br>
    <br> in my window.</p>>
